# streamlit-analytics

**ðŸ‘€ Track user inputs to your streamlit app**

A small extension for the fantastic [streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) framework.
Tracks all inputs to streamlit components in your app and visualizes the results 
directly in your browser. Think Google Analytics but for streamlit!


## Installation

Coming soon!


## How to use it

```python
import streamlit_analytics

with streamlit_analytics.track():
    st.text_input("Write something")
    st.button("Click me")
```

That's it! ðŸŽˆ All inputs & clicks will now be tracked and counted. Of course, you
can also use any other streamlit component in the `with` block (currently supported:
button, text_input, selectbox). 

To view the results, append `?analytics=on` to your app's URL 
(e.g. http://localhost:8501/?analytics=on). The results are shown directly below your 
app:

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/example.png" width=500>
</p>

If you don't want a huge `with` block, you can also manually call 
`streamlit_analytics.start_tracking()` at the beginning of your app and
`streamlit_analytics.stop_tracking()` at the end.
